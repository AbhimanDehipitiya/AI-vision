INTRODUCTION:

In modern world all most all the people use computer to do their work such as professional work,
education work and day-to-day work. Therefore, people have to have work Infront of computer for a
considerable portion of time from a day. Even though computers help to simplify our work there are
some injuries due to the overuse of computers. Among them we are going to consider about eye
related injuries and came up with a solution to avoid Digital related eye strain with the assistance of
software as a mini project.

OBJECTIVE:

20-20-20 rule is an effective way to handle Digital Eye Strain. But it not practical to follow this rule
without any timing assistance. Further it is not practical to use timers and set the time manually to get
a reminder for once every twenty minutes.
There are some apps that remind to take a rest once every twenty minutes. But the problem associated
with all those apps and software that they do not track the movement of the eye. When it comes to
office environment this is not effective hence there can be a time waste.
Therefore, the objective of this project is to reduce the eye strain of computer users while effectively
managing their work time with AI assisted reminder software.

TECHNOLOGY:

C++

OpenCV

Object Oriented Programming

In this project we have developed a GUI application that can detect blinking of eyes and count how much time he/she
has directly focused on the screen and alert it to the user.
